# GMKtec EVO-X2 Qwen API replication harness

`run_api_benchmark.py` measures a running local FreeToken server through its
OpenAI-compatible streaming API. It does not start a service, modify model
files, change llama-swap, or contact another LAN host. The script refuses to
run unless the operating system host name is GMKtec EVO-X2 or an explicitly supplied
test host.

Run a quality canary on GMKtec EVO-X2 from the isolated FreeToken environment after
the server is already warm:

```bash
python benchmarks/gmk_evo_x2/run_api_benchmark.py \
  --model qwen3.6-35b-a3b-nvfp4 \
  --tokenizer /home/david/freetoken-amd/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4 \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:1919/v1 \
  --samples 5 \
  --artifact-dir /home/david/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-replication-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
```

For a fixed-length decode TPS measurement, pass the exact paper or surrogate
prompt and opt into throughput mode. This sends `ignore_eos=true` so all samples
produce the same requested decode length:

```bash
python benchmarks/gmk_evo_x2/run_api_benchmark.py \
  --model qwen3.6-35b-a3b-nvfp4 \
  --tokenizer /home/david/freetoken-amd/models/Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4 \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:1919/v1 \
  --mode throughput --expected-text '' --max-tokens 256 \
  --prompt "<fixed benchmark prompt>" --samples 5 \
  --artifact-dir /home/david/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-throughput-$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)
```

The harness writes one immutable JSON artifact per request plus a manifest and
summary. Decode TPS is based on tokenizer-counted generated text rather than
the count of network chunks. A server that fails to provide content, returns a
malformed SSE sequence, or emits an error is marked failed rather than silently
excluded.

Quality and fixed-length throughput are intentionally separate modes. The
harness is not a paper replication until the exact published prompt, sampling,
cache state, and statistic are supplied in the protocol artifact.
Each passed sample records both decode TPS and `client_prefill_tps`.  The latter
is prompt tokens divided by warm TTFT, so it represents the client-visible
request-to-first-text boundary.  It is intentionally reported separately from
any server log's internal input-throughput line, whose timing boundary differs.

The per-sample `timing` object also records an auditable API timing breakdown:
`response_headers_seconds`, `headers_to_first_text_seconds`,
`first_text_to_stream_close_seconds`, and `last_text_to_stream_close_seconds`.
These values identify client-observable request phases only.  They do not claim
to separate tokenization, queueing, scheduler execution, model prefill, or GPU
kernel work, which the OpenAI-compatible streaming API does not expose as
independent timestamped events.  ROCm profiler evidence remains the source for
kernel-level attribution.
