# GMKtec EVO-X2 Gemma 4 Q4 GGUF vision control

## Scope

This control proves the AMD ROCm/HIP path for the locally available
`gemma-4-26B_q4_0-it.gguf` plus its sibling
`gemma-4-26B-it-mmproj.gguf` projector. It is isolated from the protected Qwen
service: the candidate binds only `127.0.0.1:1923`, and the runner restarts
Qwen on `127.0.0.1:1919` on every exit path.

## Build and runtime contract

- Host: GMKtec EVO-X2, Radeon 8060S (`gfx1151`) unified-memory GPU.
- Backend: native ROCm/HIP and Triton. No CUDA compatibility path was used.
- Text GGUF: `gemma-4-26B_q4_0-it.gguf`.
- Vision projector: sibling `gemma-4-26B-it-mmproj.gguf`.
- Opt-in: `FREETOKEN_LOAD_VISION=1`.
- Vision geometry recovered from the projector and Gemma 4 release contract:
  27 layers, hidden width 1152, 16 heads, MLP width 4304, 16-pixel patches,
  10,240 position entries, 3 by 3 pooling, and at most 280 soft tokens per
  image.
- Image API: OpenAI-compatible `messages[].content[]` with `type: image_url`.
  The initial local-safe implementation accepts `data:image/...;base64,...`
  values. It intentionally rejects remote URLs, preventing the serving process
  from becoming an arbitrary LAN or Internet fetch client.

The runner completed both controls before it shut down the candidate and
started Qwen recovery.

| Control | Result | Prompt tokens | Completion tokens | Observed latency or rate |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| Text arithmetic | `323` | 30 | 4 | TTFT 2471.37 ms, 45.52 decode tok/s across two decode steps |
| Solid red PNG data URL | `red` | 284 | 2 | 1.89 s end-to-end request time |
| Solid green PNG data URL | `green` | 284 | 2 | 1.08 s end-to-end request time |
| Red-left, blue-right PNG | `red` for the left half | 282 | 2 | 1.06 s end-to-end request time |

The image prompts had 282 to 284 tokens because the processor produced 256
image soft tokens, plus the rendered text/template tokens. All three controls
returned their expected one-word answer. The spatial split-color control shows
that the path preserves image position rather than merely detecting a dominant
global color. Together they verify decoding, resizing, patchification, shaped
inter-process tensor transport, ROCm vision-tower execution, projector
execution, image-token replacement, and OpenAI response formatting.

## Reproduction

From the isolated checkout on GMKtec EVO-X2, first ensure the protected server health
is exactly `status: ok`, then run:

```bash
bash scripts/gmk-evo-x2/run_gemma4_gguf_text_control.sh \
  /home/david/freetoken-amd/validation-qwen-gguf-d1dd473 vision
```

The control runner saves `quality.json` for the text control and
`image-quality.json` for the OpenAI image control before its cleanup trap
restarts Qwen. The image verifier is also independently callable against an
already-running isolated candidate:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=python /home/david/freetoken-amd/.venv/bin/python \
  scripts/gmk-evo-x2/verify_gemma4_gguf_image.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:1923 \
  --model gemma4-26b-q4-amd \
  --artifact /tmp/gemma4-image-quality.json
```

## Matched ROCm 10 llama.cpp control

The matched llama.cpp runner used the same text GGUF, sibling projector,
ROCm 10 installation, loopback-only OpenAI API contract, and deterministic
image fixtures. Its artifact is:

`/home/david/freetoken-amd/artifacts/gemma4-llamacpp-vision-20260830T051736Z`

| Control | FreeToken AMD ROCm/HIP | llama.cpp ROCm 10 | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Text arithmetic | `323`, 47.97 decode tok/s, 1687.71 ms TTFT | `323`, 30.99 decode tok/s, 204.23 ms TTFT | Both correct. FreeToken decoded this two-step short control 54.8% faster, while llama.cpp had lower first-token latency. |
| Solid red image | `red`, 284 prompt and 2 completion tokens, 2.27 s wall time | `red`, 82 prompt and 92 completion tokens, 56.10 generated tok/s, 1.96 s wall time | Both correct. llama.cpp emitted 91 reasoning tokens before its visible answer. |
| Solid green image | `green`, 284 prompt and 2 completion tokens, 1.08 s wall time | `green`, 82 prompt and 84 completion tokens, 56.00 generated tok/s, 1.81 s wall time | Both correct. llama.cpp emitted 83 reasoning tokens before its visible answer. |
| Red-left, blue-right image | `red`, 282 prompt and 2 completion tokens, 1.06 s wall time | `red`, 79 prompt and 121 completion tokens, 56.16 generated tok/s, 2.44 s wall time | Both correct. llama.cpp preserved spatial information but emitted 120 reasoning tokens first. |

This is a real OpenAI-compatible quality comparison, not an equivalence claim
for visual TPS. The runtimes tokenize image inputs differently, and llama.cpp
deliberately exposes a long `reasoning_content` trace on this Gemma template.
That makes its reported 56 tok/s an internally useful decode measurement but
not directly comparable to FreeToken's two-token user-visible response. On the
user-visible contract FreeToken completed the green and split-image controls
faster; on the first cold red request llama.cpp was faster.

The text result is directly comparable because both runners used the same
caller-rendered prompt and returned the same four completion tokens. It shows
that the current native FreeToken ROCm/HIP path exceeds the matched llama.cpp
decode rate for that bounded control, but it does not establish a general
long-output advantage.

## Long visual response boundary

The deterministic split-color fixture was extended to require a 45 to 65 word
visible description containing the colors and their left-to-right arrangement.
FreeToken passed this quality gate with 51 visible words, 63 completion tokens,
1,093.83 ms TTFT, and 53.87 completion tokens per second over a 1.169 s
stream window. Its artifact is
`/home/david/freetoken-amd/artifacts/gemma4-gguf-vision-20260830T055500Z`.

The matched ROCm 10 llama.cpp model recognized the same image correctly but
placed every generated token in `reasoning_content`, leaving visible `content`
empty. This remained true at both 512 and 1,024 completion-token caps. The
1,024-token diagnostic reached 55.91 generated tokens per second but failed
the visible-output quality gate, so it is not comparable to FreeToken's 53.87
visible-output TPS. This is a response-format/API-contract limitation of this
llama.cpp Gemma invocation, not evidence that it failed visual understanding.

## Recovery-contract result

The final isolated FreeToken vision run is
`/home/david/freetoken-amd/artifacts/gemma4-gguf-vision-20260830T053317Z`.
It passed all three image controls (`red`, `green`, and spatial `red`), then
shut down the candidate and restored the protected Qwen server. Qwen reported
the authoritative `status: ok` after about eight minutes and twenty seconds;
the control runner then exited cleanly. This verifies that the runner now
handles the real serial-NVFP4 recovery envelope without a false success while
Qwen is still loading or a false failure from re-running its launcher.

## Boundary and next measurement

The image controls are functionality and short-request measurements, not a
long-output visual throughput benchmark. The next performance phase should use
a fixed visual-description task, a quality rubric that scores both visible and
reasoning channels separately, warmup exclusion, multiple repetitions, and
streaming telemetry. That will measure prompt TPS, first-token latency, and
decode TPS without rewarding a runtime merely for emitting more hidden
reasoning tokens.

## Extended quality control, 2026-09-02

The immutable isolated artifact
`/home/david/freetoken-amd/artifacts/gemma4-gguf-vision-20260902T165806Z/`
expanded the vision suite beyond the original three fixtures. The native
ROCm/HIP Gemma API first repeated the deterministic `17 * 19 = 323` text
control, then passed all seven image fixtures: solid red, green, blue, and
yellow, plus left, right, and top spatial-color questions on two-color images.
Every visible answer matched the required lowercase color.

The same run completed the bounded visual-description quality control. Given a
red-left, blue-right rectangle, it returned a 51-word visible description that
contained `red`, `blue`, `left`, and `right`, satisfying the required 45 to 65
word range. Streaming evidence recorded 63 completion tokens, 1,142.04 ms
TTFT, and 53.27 visible completion tokens per second.

The controller used the maintained Qwen recovery checkout rather than the
retired historical harness path. After the temporary Gemma server exited, the
protected Qwen health endpoint returned `status: ok`. This qualifies the
recorded deterministic text and image controls, not general visual reasoning
quality beyond those fixtures.
