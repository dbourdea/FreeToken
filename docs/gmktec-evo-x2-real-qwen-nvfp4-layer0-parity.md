# GMKtek EVO-X2 real Qwen NVFP4 layer-zero parity

## Purpose

This bounded experiment loads only the first routed-expert layer from the
actual Qwen3.6 NVFP4 checkpoint, then compares the production Marlin decode
kernel with FreeToken's retained LUT-gather baseline. The loader stops when
layer zero is delivered, so later layers are not materialized and the complete
checkpoint is never loaded into the isolated process.

## Configuration

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Checkpoint | `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-NVFP4` |
| Layer | 0 |
| Experts in source bank | 256 |
| Hidden size | 2,048 |
| Intermediate size | 512 |
| Routed experts tested | 8 |
| Input | Deterministic BF16 hidden vector |
| Kernel comparison | Marlin NVFP4 versus LUT-gather NVFP4 |
| Runtime | Native HIP on `gfx1151` |

The source loader provided the actual packed NVFP4 tensors, FP8 block scales,
and FP16 per-row global scales from the checkpoint. No synthetic weights were
used in this test.

## Real-bank fingerprints

The captured layer-zero source banks had these SHA-256 fingerprints:

```

## Result

The two production kernels produced exactly identical output for the same
real checkpoint bytes and deterministic input:

```text
max_abs_diff=0.0
mean_abs_diff=0.0
outputs_finite=true
```

Ten Marlin samples, including first-use effects, were:

```text
[0.422324, 4.516500, 0.316868, 0.285419, 0.282369,
 0.238581, 0.134624, 0.121815, 0.124095, 0.127925] ms
```

The final eight steady-state samples averaged **0.203962 ms**. The eight
routed experts read approximately 12.58 MiB of packed gate/up and down input
per call, equivalent to approximately **61.7 GB/s** of routed packed input
traffic. This is a component result, not end-to-end model TPS.

## Interpretation

This closes the most important numerical uncertainty before a live candidate:
the production Marlin path can consume real Qwen NVFP4 checkpoint data on HIP
and match the baseline exactly for a deterministic routed layer operation.
The unusually high second sample is retained rather than discarded because
it is evidence of first-use or runtime scheduling overhead.

The result does not yet establish a full serving improvement. It excludes the
router, attention, KV management, scheduler, host-side cache misses, API
overhead, and all other decoder layers. A candidate replacement still needs a
complete API quality and throughput gate.

## Next action

Run the same real-bank differential across several deterministic hidden-state
vectors and routed expert sets, then attach the candidate to an isolated Qwen
server. Compare full API prefill, decode, TTFT, tail latency, concurrency,
quality hashes, and recovery against the qualified current configuration.
