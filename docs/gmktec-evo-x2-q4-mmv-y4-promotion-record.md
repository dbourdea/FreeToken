# Q4 MMV_Y=4 promotion record

This record documents the reproducible FreeToken Q4 candidate measured on the
GMKtek EVO-X2. It is an evidence record, not a claim that the candidate has
already replaced the protected service configuration.

## Candidate identity

- Candidate source revision: `fb4e0232dbd7804b7d86c1ddd2dd366e2b0c05a7`.
- Model file: `Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q4_K_M.gguf`.
- Model SHA-256: `ac0e2c1189e055faa36eff361580e79c5bd6f8e76bffb4ce547f167d53e31a61`.
- GPU: AMD Radeon 8060S Graphics, architecture `gfx1151`.
- PyTorch: `2.13.0+rocm10.0.0`.
- HIP runtime reported by PyTorch: `7.15.26333`.
- Python: `3.12.13`, Clang-backed environment.
- Reusable extension cache: `/home/operator/freetoken-amd/cache/torch_extensions-q8-api-y4`.

## Runtime configuration

The candidate was started on an isolated loopback port with the following
performance-affecting settings:

```text
FREETOKEN_GGUF_MMV_Y=4
FREETOKEN_GGUF_Q8_MMV_WARPS=1
PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH=gfx1151
ROCM_HOME=/opt/rocm-10.0
ROCM_PATH=/opt/rocm-10.0
HIP_PATH=/opt/rocm-10.0
--attention-backend triton
--moe-backend offload
--nvfp4-backend triton
--expert-load serial
--moe-cache-auto
--memory-ratio 0.25
--max-seq-len-override 8192
--kv-reserve-tokens 8192
--cuda-graph-max-bs 0
--disable-pynccl
--disable-moe-prefill-overlap
```

The Q8 warp count remains one because the current implementation deliberately
rejects multiwarp Q8 values. The accepted experiment changes `MMV_Y`, which is
the supported dense activation launch geometry.

## Acceptance evidence

The first five-sample API run is preserved at:

`/home/operator/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-q4-mmv-y4-api5-20260905T075002Z`

Its mean decode rate was 48.03 TPS, with five successful samples and a
standard deviation of 0.054 TPS. The independent repeat is preserved at:

`/home/operator/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-q4-mmv-y4-repeat-20260905T082425Z`

The repeat measured 47.86 TPS across five successful samples, with a standard
deviation of 0.092 TPS. The matched ROCm10 llama.cpp control measured 48.75
TPS, so the repeat was approximately 1.8 percent slower in decode.

The quality and state evidence is preserved at:

`/home/operator/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-q4-mmv-y4-quality-20260905T080132Z`

The deterministic suite passed its exact, arithmetic, and JSON cases. The
three-turn state suite passed acknowledgment, recall, and transformation.

The long-context and resource evidence is preserved at:

`/home/operator/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-q4-mmv-y4-longctx-20260905T081222Z`

Five nonce-varied 6,056-token prompts passed exact marker retrieval. Available
memory changed from 19 GiB to 18 GiB. Swap use decreased from 2.1 GiB to 710
MiB. GPU temperature changed from 35 C to 54 C, GPU use reached 91 percent,
and measured power reached 110 W.

## Promotion decision

The candidate is reproducible and passes the current functional, quality,
long-context, and resource gates. It should be treated as the leading Q4
optimization candidate, but not silently installed as the protected default.
Before permanent promotion, rerun the documented commands from a clean shell,
verify the reusable extension cache contents, and attach the resulting build
log and final source diff to the upstream review record.

## Clean-shell reproduction

The fresh-cache reproduction was completed from a clean remote shell using the
same source revision, ROCm 10.0 paths, `gfx1151` target, `MMV_Y=4`, and Q8
one-wave guard. The native build invoked `/opt/rocm-10.0/bin/hipcc` and emitted
the expected `-DGGML_CUDA_MMV_Y=4` and `--offload-arch=gfx1151` flags.

- Artifact: `/home/operator/freetoken-amd/artifacts/qwen-q8-mmv-y4-clean-20260905T084057Z`.
- Real-weight Q8 screen: 25.983 microseconds mean over 300 repetitions.
- Device and software identity matched the candidate record.
- Build and benchmark output is preserved in `build-and-bench.log`.

## Known limitations

The client-visible prefill rate remains far below the llama.cpp control even
though decode throughput is nearly matched. The long-context test is a local
6,056-token retrieval control and is not a reproduction of the paper's agent
workload. The quality suite is deterministic and bounded; it does not replace
the paper's full tool-using evaluation.
## Current-branch requalification

The opt-in Y4 flag was requalified from current AMD branch commit `ff76ede` in
an isolated checkout with the protected service stopped through its guarded
lifecycle. Startup reached the explicit API-ready state with 56 GiB free before
model loading and 23.07 GiB free after initialization. The current branch then
completed the fixed three-sample scheduler-shaped matrix:

- decode mean: 45.4603 TPS
- decode median: 45.4418 TPS
- decode standard deviation: 0.0927 TPS
- client-observed prefill mean: 2,753.3639 TPS
- maximum token gap: 43.781 ms
- failed samples: zero

The canonical Q4 quality output was produced with SHA1 `3302eda43396`. The
quality verifier now accepts an explicit `--expected-sha1 3302eda43396` contract
selector while preserving the historical paper-inspired default
`0acef4eab6f4`. This prevents a contract mismatch from being misreported as a
model-quality failure. The selected hash and observed hash are both retained in
the raw artifact. A prior protected-service re-anchor recorded
`cd580f4978fb` under a different source or request contract. The explicit
current verifier contract returned `0acef4eab6f4` on the healthy protected
service, so neither fingerprint may be treated as universal. This Y4 run
remains a source-matched historical Q4 result only.

Against the accepted current Q4 scheduler baseline near 48.28 decode TPS, this
current-branch Y4 result is approximately 5.8 percent slower. **Decision:
reject Y4 for promotion on the current branch.** It is not comparable to the
separate protected-service re-anchor without the exact source and request
manifest. The compile-time option
remains available only for reproduction and future architecture-specific work;
the default remains Y1. The protected Qwen service was restored and its health
endpoint returned `status: ok` with `maintenance: serving` after the candidate
stopped.
## Same-source Y1 control

To remove the remaining source-revision confounder, the same checkout and
request contract were rerun with `FREETOKEN_GGUF_MMV_Y=1` in a separate
isolated artifact. The three-sample scheduler-shaped control measured:

- decode mean: 45.3341 TPS
- client-observed prefill mean: 2,682.4559 TPS
- decode standard deviation: 0.0619 TPS
- failed samples: zero
- quality: passed with `--expected-sha1 3302eda43396`

The paired Y4 result was 45.4603 decode TPS and 2,753.3639 prefill TPS. Y4 was
therefore only 0.28 percent faster in this same-source comparison, well below
the one-percent promotion floor and normal run variation. **Decision:
definitively reject Y4 as a current-branch performance promotion.**
